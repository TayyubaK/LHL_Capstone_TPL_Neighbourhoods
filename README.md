# LHL_Capstone_TPL_Neighbourhoods

The Toronto Public Library network is a city service comprising of 100 physical branches spread out within the 158 neighbourhoods of Toronto. Libraries allow borrowing of physical and electronic materials, but can also be a hub for community programs and resources.

During COVID-19 access to physical branches was restricted, and recently, in late 2023 the Toronto Public Library faced a major cybersecurity incident. The purpose of this analysis is to take a look at how libraries are faring before, during, and after the challenges, and how they're being used in Toronto.


## Project/Goals
Use data analysis techinques to explore, wrangle, and create user-friendly informative visuals about the use of Toronto libraries.
