In fact, when an established artist saw my artwork for the first time a while back, she found it inspirational and said I give women a voice through my work.""<br /><br />Mah Noor Khan started her creative journey with acrylic painting as a youth and now focused on sketchbook coloured pencil drawings.

15,Branch Art Exhibits: Philippe McNally,2023-10-01,2023-10-31,None,None,,Bloor/Gladstone,None,"""Philippe McNally is a self-taught and classically-trained mixed-media artist. He began working with digital art and 3D animation before going back to<br />school to study ne arts and illustration at George Brown College, where he began to focus on permanent and dynamic physical media including penand-ink, watercolour, distressed materials, and photographed textures. He was born on Manitoulin Island in 1982, and has lived in Toronto since 2001,<br />and maintains a large garden on his balcony.""<br /><br /><br />""Drawing with pen-and-ink began as way of working through the anxiety of changing my environment. Because every mark is permanent, it must be<br />worked with, or worked around, but never removed. Each mark is 'digital' - on or off - but controlled with the analog motion of the hand, wrist, arm,<br />breath, and eye. Each mark is only as important as the mark or the empty space next to it, where every aspect is in contrast and opposition to its<br />neighbour. My work is an attempt to use opposition to render new life growing out of decay, and the ways that the natural and articial world are<br />intertwined.""<br /><br /><br />This exhibit is part of TPL'S Art Exhibit Space program. Toronto Public Library provides space for local artists to exhibit their work at locations across the city. These exhibits aim to reflect the diverse cultural interests of the city and its neighbourhoods.<br /><br /><br />The exhibit can be viewed during open hours.

Haunted by his past and weary of his present, Boyd has one goal before the authorities catch up with him: settle a score with the man who destroyed his life. By Monday Boyd and Angie reach Mexico; by winter, they are in a lakefront mansion in Minnesota. On their trail are hitmen, jealous lovers, ex-cons, an heiress, a billionaire shipping tycoon, a three-tour veteran of Iraq, and the ghosts of Boyd's past. Everyone, it seems, except the police. <br /><br />Tim O'Brien speaks with journalist and author Michael LaPointe about America Fantastica, a book which puts a mirror to a nation, and a time, that has become dangerously unmoored from truth and greedy for delusion.<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow.

Formes documentaires : le style,2023-10-31,,6:00 PM,7:00 PM,60,Toronto Reference Library,Founders' Room,"Réaliser un documentaire est un exercice personnel qui repose sur quelques éléments clefs. Cet atelier est ouvert à celles et ceux qui s'intéressent au cinéma et à ses processus de création ; il permet d'explorer ensemble les questions d'esthétiques et de narration, avec des exemples de films ou de dossiers écrits. <br /><br />L'objectif est de déconstruire le processus de création et d'expérience du spectateur. Cet atelier questionne la forme à travers la narration : quels sont les modes narratifs visuels employés, comment sont-ils construits et quels sont les enjeux de ces usages ? À travers des exemples de films comme Le Joli Mai de Chris Marker, Les Glaneurs et la glaneuse de Agnès Varda ou Risk de Laura Poitras, le documentaire offre une multitude de possibilités.<br /><br />À travers son expérience de réalisation et d'accompagnement de films, Marine Ottogalli propose aux participant·e·s de questionner leurs propres envies de films et de les confronter aux étapes principales de la réalisation documentaire. Réalisatrice de documentaires (Ayi, 2019, Sveinn-à-Mulà, l'islandais qui n'avait plus d'essence), et directrice de la photo (Human, Yann-Arthus Bertrand, Les Reines du palace, Karine Morales, L'École est Finie, Julie Chauvin) Marine Ottogalli travaille depuis plus de dix ans dans l'industrie cinématographique. <br /><br />Cet atelier se déroulera dans Founders' Room de la Bibliothèque de référence.<br /><br />L'inscription à cet atelier commence le 10 octobre.<br /><br />Si vous avez des questions, contactez-nous à programmesenfrancais@tpl.ca<br /><br />****<br /><br />La Bibliothèque publique de Toronto s'est engagée à assurer l'accessibilité.

Is it morally right to prevent prisoners from accessing certain information and prevent them from pursuing their own education? What are the implications when society sees prisons not as places of punishment, but as places of rehabilitation?<br /><br />In 2018, the Canadian Federation of Library Associations adopted ""The Right to Read"" statement, which affirms incarcerated Canadians do not relinquish their guaranteed rights and freedoms  under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, noting how these freedoms provide prisoners with a rare and critical connection to the outside world. Kirsten Wurmann, chair of the Manitoba Library Association's Prison Libraries Committee, joins Garrett Felber, an organizer with Study and Struggle and the Martin Sostre Institute, and Kyon Ferril, a former immigration detainee and founding member of Migrant Detainee Support Coalition, to discuss the impacts of censorship in Canadian and American prisons. Moderated by human rights lawyer Fathima Cader.<br /><br />Who decides what information prisoners have access to? What's at stake when prisoners' relationships with the outside world are censored?

In the face of these intentional attacks, the Ukrainian librarian community mobilized and transformed themselves into ""warrior librarians,"" working tirelessly to preserve artifacts, national treasures, state archives and priceless manuscripts to protect Ukrainian national identity and Slavic history.<br /><br />In this compelling discussion, Valentyna Pashkovam, Ukrainian Library Association (ULA) founder, Oksana Brui, ULA president and Yaroslava Soshynska, ULA executive director, discuss the staggering task of protecting Ukrainian libraries. Moderated by author and cultural commentator Stephen Marche.<br /><br />What's at stake when libraries are one of the first targets of falling bombs?

Ben Ferencz, age 98, is the last surviving Nuremberg trial prosecutor and he is on a life-long crusade in the fight for law not war. After the Holocaust camps were liberated, Ferencz became a lead prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials. He prosecuted 22 Einsatzgruppen Nazis responsible for murdering over a million Jews. Called the biggest murder trial in history, Ferencz was only 27, and it was his first case. He would go on to advocate for restitution for Jewish victims of the holocaust and later the establishment of the International Criminal Court. His fight for justice for victims of atrocity crimes continues today.<br /><br />Light refreshments provided. <br /><br />Registration required. <br />Please register by calling Barbara Frum Library at (416)395-5440.<br /><br /><br />Accessibility<br />Toronto Public Library is committed to accessibility.

Their parents had lived their formative years through depression and war. They themselves were born into a postwar world of new homes, new schools, new churches. New suburbs. Of new classes like this one. Of boundless possibilities.<br /><br />Ken Dryden was one of these thirty-five. In his varied, improbable life, he had wondered often how he had gotten from there to here. How any of us do. He decided to try and find his classmates, to see how they are, what they are doing, how life has been for them. They talked many long hours, in a way they had never talked before. <br /><br />Ken Dryden speaks with journalist and author Carol Off about The Class, a book which asks us to consider, when almost anything seems within reach, what do we reach for?<br /><br />Q&A and book signing to follow. Books available for purchase.<br /><br />Ticket registration for this event is required: Free tickets for this event will be available to book via <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ken-dryden-the-class-north-york-central-library-tickets-700917451967?aff=oddtdtcreator"">Eventbrite</a> beginning on October 25 at 9:00am ET.<br /><br />About this event's guests:<br /><a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/authors/7480/ken-dryden"">Ken Dryden</a><br /><a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/authors/22670/carol-off"">Carol Off</a><br /><br />Read more:<br /><a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM4420657&R=4420657"">The Class</a><br /><a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM4249845&R=4249845"">The Series: What I Remember, What It Felt Like, What It Feels Like Now</a><br /><br />***<br /><br />This event is part of our signature <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/programs-and-classes/featured/salon-series/"">Salon Series</a>, where we host local and international authors, artists and thinkers in conversation about their new books and big ideas.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Note: This is an in-person event at the <a href=""https://venuerentals.tpl.ca/concourse-event-space"">North York Central Library Concourse</a>, Toronto Public Library's new premiere event space for cultural and heritage programming located at 5120 Yonge Street (west side of Yonge St, one block north of Sheppard Ave).<br /><br />Arrive early, meet people.

In <i>The Mother of All Degrassi</i>, she shares her strong belief that television is all about the story, and a good story is all about making the political personal. Through anecdotes and introspection - and some great behind-the-scenes stories for Degrassi fans - Linda examines her philosophy to dream big, think small, meet life head-on, and always keep an open heart. <a href=""https://ecwpress.com/products/mother-of-all-degrassi"">[Source]</a><br /><br /><b>Future Titles:</b><br />Thursday, December 14 - <i>Much Ado About Nada</i> by Uzma Jalaluddin<br /><br />New members welcome.

Prominent Jewish comic creators such as Will Eisner, Art Spiegelman and Horst Rosenthal's works will be examined in terms of their use of stereotypes and caricature within the constrictions of the comic form. This lecture unpacks how Jewish comics draw attention to, employ, resist and wrestle with the conventional use of stereotype and how we can better understand what insights their practice might hold for both creators of anti-racist comics and comic studies as a discipline.<br /><br />This program is presented by Jamie Michaels, TPL's Fall 2023 Writer in Residence whose focus is Graphic Novels.

886,Maria Popova: The Path to War Between Russia and Ukraine,2023-11-09,,7:00 PM,8:30 PM,90,Toronto Reference Library,Bram & Bluma Appel Salon,"TPL and Toronto Metropolitan University presents Associate Professor with the McGill University Department of Political Science, Maria Popova in conversation with Sanjay Ruparelia and Arne Kislenko, at Toronto Reference Library's Appel Salon space.<br /><br />The war between Russia and Ukraine has ignited fierce debate on its causes as well as how it might end around the world. Realists claim that it was the result of great power rivalry between Russia and the United States. The expansion of NATO membership to former members of the Warsaw Pact, according to this view, instilled a sense of insecurity that provoked President Vladimir Putin and his regime. Yet this view has been undermined by Putin's calm acceptance of NATO's most recent expansion to Finland and Sweden, right up to Russia's borders. The view also discounts how the states that emerged from the collapse of the USSR diverged in their aspirations and institutions since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia slid back into authoritarianism and imperialism, while Ukraine consolidated a competitive political system and fledgling democracy, determined to pursue European integration as a sovereign nation-state.<br /><br />How did the expansion of autocracy and democracy shape each country over the last two decades? Why has Ukraine resisted Russia better than many had anticipated? What are the prospects for peace, recovery and democracy in each polity in the years ahead?<br /><br />The distinguished political scientist Maria Popova examines these debates in conversation with Sanjay Ruparelia and Arne Kislenko.<br /><br />Question and answer session to follow.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Read More:<br /><br />About <a href=""https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/maria-popova"">Maria Popova</a><br />About <a href=""https://www.torontomu.ca/politics/people/faculty/ruparelia-sanjay/"">Sanjay Ruparelia</a><br />About <a href=""https://www.torontomu.ca/history/about-us/faculty-and-staff/faculty/kislenko-arne/"">Arne Kislenko</a><br /><br />***<br /><br />About the series:<br /><br />On the Frontlines of Democracy is a public lecture series to analyze the trajectory of democracy in the twenty-first century. In every region, the prospects of democracy face serious challenges, old and new. Can we protect constitutional rights and renew collective self-rule in an era of popular mistrust, severe partisanship and resurgent nationalism? Can they reduce inequalities of power, wealth and status, defend deep diversity and confront climate change in the new digital age? Can we develop innovative strategies to revitalize civic engagement, empower public institutions and resist autocratic threats? And what can we offer, learn and do to promote the prospects of democracy in our increasingly post-western global order?<br /><br />***<br /><br />This event is part of our signature <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/programs-and-classes/featured/on-civil-society.jsp"">On Civil Society</a> series, where we host local and international authors, activists and academics in conversation about the most critical topics of our time.

In The Mother of All Degrassi, she shares her strong belief that television is all about the story, and a good story is all about making the political personal. Through anecdotes and introspection  and some great behind-the-scenes stories for Degrassi fans  Linda examines her philosophy to dream big, think small, meet life head-on, and always keep an open heart. <a href="" https://ecwpress.com/products/mother-of-all-degrassi"">[Source]</a><br /><br />Copies of the title are available to borrow in Print, eBook and eAudiobook format from the Toronto Public Library collection.<br /><br />We will be using <a href=""https://meet.jit.si/"">Jitsi Meet</a>, an online meeting platform for our book discussion.

Koh, the author of the multi-award winning memoir <a href=""https://tinhouse.com/book/the-magical-language-of-others/""target=""_blank"">The Magical Language of Others</a>, talks about her debut novel, <a href=""https://tinhouse.com/book/liberators-ebk-koh/""target=""_blank"">The Liberators</a> - an elegantly wrought family saga of memory, trauma, and empathy that begins at the height of the military dictatorship in South Korea and echoes for generations to come. <br /><br />The couple at the center are Insuk and Sungho who are arranged to be married and move from South Korea to San Jose, California with an infant and Sungho's overbearing mother-in-law. Adrift in a new country, Insuk grieves the loss of her past and her divided homeland, finding herself drawn into an illicit relationship. Throughout the novel, E.J. draws exquisite portraits and testimony from guards, prisoners, perpetrators, and liberators that span continents and four generations of two Korean families forever changed by fateful past decisions made in love and war. <br /><br />E.J. Koh talks with Toronto-based art and storytelling facilitator Erin Kang about The Liberators, a powerful and poetic account of a divided country and the impact of that division on the Korean diaspora.<br /><br />About this event's guests:<br /><a href=""https://www.ejkoh.com/""target=""_blank"">E.J.

But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined.

Radon is a soil gas that can be found in elevated levels in certain homes. Radon is the second-leading cause of lung cancer, surpassed only by smoking. It's important that everyone test their homes for radon, and take action to reduce their radon level if required.<br /><br />Why November? November is <a href=""https://takeactiononradon.ca/about/"">Radon Action Month</a> - a perfect time to start your home radon test! Health Canada suggests measuring radon for a minimum of three months' time, preferably during the heating season. This makes November the perfect time to order a radon test kit, and start measuring the level in your home.<br /><br />This program will be available for replay at the same link after the program airs.<br /><br />Read Crowdcast's <a href=""https://www.crowdcast.io/privacy-policy"">Privacy Policy</a><br /><br />See Crowdcast's <a href=""https://support.crowdcast.io/attendee--speakers/aWHPyjGSdwAXR5zJ4UwHeL/attendee-guide/tr6Qt5SSbQnExmXJFE9xC6"">Attendee Guide</a><br /><br />Questions about online programs?

Like never before, our access to information has been radically altered and put into the hands of a small group of powerful companies that claim to have our best interests at heart. But the reality is our views can often be shaped by those same corporations, without us even realizing we're being manipulated.<br /><br />Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen talks with journalist, activist and author Cory Doctorow about standing up against one of today's most powerful organizations and the power of a single individual to demand transparency and accountability to Big Tech. In 2021, Haugen publicly disclosed her identity as the anonymous Wall Street Journal source in an investigative series, ""The Facebook Files: A Wall Street Journal Investigation."" The investigation included the social media platform's negative impact on youth, misinformation, weaknesses in its response to human trafficking and drug cartels, and revealed how Facebook's algorithm favoured anger and outrage to keep us doom scrolling.<br /><br />What's at stake when social media giants continue their unchecked growth in power and information access? What are the impacts of technology on our society? And how can we maintain our individual voices when faced with an unrelenting tsunami of corporate power?<br /><br />Join the conversation.<br /><br />Question and answer session and book signing to follow.

Tess and Emily are reeling after their ugly separation and fighting over ownership of the embryos that were supposed to grow their family together. And thousands of miles away, the unknown man who served as anonymous donor to them all is being held in captivity in Somalia. While his life remains in precarious balance, his genetic material is a source of both creation and conflict. What does it mean to be a family in our rapidly shifting world? What are our responsibilities to each other with increasing options for how to create a family? As these characters grapple with life-altering changes, they will find themselves interconnected in ways they cannot have imagined, and forced to redefine what family means to them.""<br /><br /><br />Future selections:<br />November 29: The Relatives by Camilla Gibb<br />December 27: The Refugees by Viet Thanh Nguyen<br /><br />This is a drop-in program.<br />For more information, please visit the branch or call 416-393-7663.<br /><br />Accessibility  <br /><br />Toronto Public Library is committed to accessibility.

2226,Stories We Retell: Myth & Legend in Three Novels,2023-11-30,,12:00 PM,1:00 PM,60,All Branches,None,"Authors Kate Heartfield, S. L. Huang, and Phoenicia Rogerson join us to discuss their new novels, retelling classic Norse, Chinese, and Greco-Roman tales. <br /><br />Kate Heartfield's <a href=""https://www.harpercollins.ca/9780008567767/the-valkyrie/"">The Valkyrie</a> is a lyrical retelling of one of Norse mythology's greatest epics, introducing us to Brynhild, a Valkyrie in exile; Gudrun, a princess of Burgundy and prize for an invading king; and Sigurd, a warrior with a sword sharper than the new moon. As the legends tell, these names are destined to be rivals, fated as enemies. But in the world of Midgard, legends can be lies.<br /><br />Inspired by a classic of martial arts literature, S. L. Huang's <a href=""https://services.raincoast.com/scripts/b2b.wsc/featured?hh_isbn=9781250180421&ht_orig_from=raincoast"">The Water Outlaws</a> are bandits of devastating ruthlessness, unseemly femininity, dangerous philosophies, and ungovernable gender who are ready to make history - or tear it apart. Disgraced and on the run, Lin Chong is recruited by the Bandits of Liangshan, mountain outlaws on the margins of society who proclaim a belief in justice - for women, for the downtrodden, for progressive thinkers a corrupt Empire would imprison or destroy. <br /><br />Phoenicia Rogerson's <a href=""https://www.harpercollins.ca/9781335016775/herc/"">Herc</a> is a queer, revisionist retelling of the myth of Hercules which gives voice to silenced characters. Told with humor and heart, this is not the story of Hercules, but the story of everyone else - his friends, his enemies, his wives, his children, his lovers, his rivals, his gods, and his victim.<br /><br />Kate Heartfield, S. L. Huang, and Phoenicia Rogerson speak with journalist Tabassum Siddiqui about their new novels and what it means to reconsider, reimagine, and retell some of history's most beloved myths and legends.<br /><br />About this event's guests:<br /><a href=""https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/kate-heartfield"">Kate Heartfield</a><br /><a href=""https://www.slhuang.com/press-kit/"">S.

2276,The Last Waltz-SR Documentary Film Series,2023-11-30,,6:00 PM,8:30 PM,150,North York Central Library,Room 101,"Join the Society and Recreation department of the North York Central Library in Rm. 101 for monthly screenings of films that push the limits of non-fiction filmmaking. This month's movie is Martin Scorsese's The Last Waltz (1978).<br /><br />Synopsis (The Criterion Collection): More than just one of the greatest concert films ever made, The Last Waltz is an at once ecstatic and elegiac summation of a vital era in American rock music. Invited to capture the farewell performance of the legendary group the Band at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom on Thanksgiving, 1976, Martin Scorsese conceived a new kind of music documentary. Enlisting seven camera operators (led by director of photography Michael Chapman, and also including renowned cinematographers Vilmos Zsigmond and László Kovács) and production designer Boris Leven to design the strikingly theatrical sets, Scorsese created a grandly immersive experience that brings viewers onstage and inside the music itself.

Facing barriers at every turn including a complex loan system, not having enough money for food, and navigating the judgements of professors and fellow students who didn't understand the demands of attending college while under the poverty line - Land finds a way to survive once again, finally graduating in her mid-thirties.<br /><br />Deborah almost didn't make it to university, but even after graduating and overcoming many of the usual barriers faced by working class people, she still felt anxious about her place and reluctant to broach the subject of class. In <a href=""https://www.biblioasis.com/shop/new-releases/on-class/""target=""_blank"">On Class</a>, she talks to writers, activists, those who work with the poor and those who are poor about what happens when we don't talk about poverty or class - and what will happen when we do.<br /><br />In this timely conversation, Stephanie Land and Deborah Dundas consider the ways in which we talk about class: who tells the stories and who doesn't, which ones tend to be repeated most often, and why this has to change. <br /><br />About this event's guests:<br /><a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Stephanie-Land/171337749""target=""_blank"">Stephanie Land</a><br /><a href=""https://www.biblioasis.com/brand/dundas-deborah/""target=""_blank"">Deborah Dundas</a><br /><br />Read more:<br /><a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM4420658&R=4420658""target=""_blank"">Class</a><br /><a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM4198432&R=4198432""target=""_blank"">On Class</a><br /><a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM3726261&R=3726261""target=""_blank"">Maid</a><br /><br />***<br /><br />This event is part of our signature <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/programs-and-classes/featured/on-civil-society.jsp""target=""_blank"">On Civil Society</a> series, where we host local and international authors, activists and academics in conversation about the most critical topics of our time.

Dans cet atelier nous explorons les questionnements auxquels doit faire face un cinéaste avant de se lancer dans la réalisation. Comment communiquer autour d'un film qui est dans son esprit ? Comment mettre en mots ce que le film doit mettre en image ?  <br /><br />À travers son expérience de réalisation et d'accompagnement de films, Marine Ottogalli propose aux participant·e·s de questionner leurs propres envies de films et de les confronter aux étapes principales de la réalisation documentaire. Réalisatrice de documentaires (Ayi, 2019, Sveinn-à-Mulà, l'islandais qui n'avait plus d'essence), et directrice de la photo (Human, Yann-Arthus Bertrand, Les Reines du palace, Karine Morales, L'École est Finie, Julie Chauvin) Marine Ottogalli travaille depuis plus de dix ans dans l'industrie cinématographique. <br /><br />Cet atelier se déroulera dans Founders' Room de la Bibliothèque de référence.<br /><br />L'inscription à cet atelier commence le 14 novembre.<br /><br />Si vous avez des questions, contactez-nous à programmesenfrancais@tpl.ca<br /><br />****<br /><br />La Bibliothèque publique de Toronto s'est engagée à assurer l'accessibilité.

Moderated by longtime activist and former broadcast journalist Jeanne McGuire.<br /><br />Why is the fight for academic freedom relevant to those outside of academia?

The advent of AI raises many concerns like algorithmic bias and privacy.<br /> <br />One core way to advance socially responsible AI is to promote AI literacy and explainable AI. <br /><br />In 2015 Google released its in-house developed AI Python library called Tensorflow on an open-source license. Since then Tensorflow has emerged as a core industry standard and one of the most accessible AI libraries. <br /><br />In this tutorial you will learn how to build a simple single-layer deep learning image classifier using Tensorflow.  The workshop will introduce participants to the key ideas behind a deep learning model as well as the core Tensorflow functions needed to build a sequential model. We will be using Google Colaboratory environment to build and run our model. <br /><br />Some knowledge of Python or coding is encouraged. For participants that have no prior Python knowledge, TPL offers on-going user education tutorials on Python you can enroll in <a href=""https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37867&Ntt=python"">here</a>.

Les méthodes : la temporalité,2023-12-12,,6:00 PM,7:00 PM,60,Toronto Reference Library,Founders' Room,"Réaliser un documentaire est un exercice personnel qui repose sur quelques éléments clefs. Cet atelier est ouvert à celles et ceux qui s'intéressent au cinéma et à ses processus de création ; il permet d'explorer ensemble les questions desthétiques et de narration, avec des exemples de films ou de dossiers écrits. <br /><br />L'objectif est de déconstruire le processus de création et d'expérience du spectateur. Chaque film a sa propre durée : de gestation, de création et de production. De l'idée à la sortie d'un film, en passant par le choix de durée du film lui-même, les temporalités des films en racontent parfois autant que le film lui-même. Qu'est-ce que le temps fait au film documentaire et à ceux qui y contribuent ? Quel temps peut-on accorder à la réalisation d'un film ? <br /><br />À travers son expérience de réalisation et d'accompagnement de films, Marine Ottogalli propose aux participant·e·s de questionner leurs propres envies de films et de les confronter aux étapes principales de la réalisation documentaire. Réalisatrice de documentaires (Ayi, 2019, Sveinn-à-Mulà, l'islandais qui n'avait plus d'essence), et directrice de la photo (Human, Yann-Arthus Bertrand, Les Reines du palace, Karine Morales, L'École est Finie, Julie Chauvin) Marine Ottogalli travaille depuis plus de dix ans dans l'industrie cinématographique. <br /><br />Cet atelier se déroulera dans Founders' Room de la Bibliothèque de référence.<br /><br />L'inscription à cet atelier commence le 21 novembre.<br /><br />Si vous avez des questions, contactez-nous à programmesenfrancais@tpl.ca<br /><br />****<br /><br />La Bibliothèque publique de Toronto s'est engagée à assurer l'accessibilité.

Transgressions du genre,2023-12-19,,6:00 PM,7:00 PM,60,Toronto Reference Library,Founders' Room,"Réaliser un documentaire est un exercice personnel qui repose sur quelques éléments clefs. Cet atelier est ouvert à celles et ceux qui s'intéressent au cinéma et à ses processus de création ; il permet d'explorer ensemble les questions d'esthétiques et de narration, avec des exemples de films ou de dossiers écrits. <br /><br />L'objectif est de déconstruire le processus de création et d'expérience du spectateur. Les frontières du genre documentaire sont poreuses. Beaucoup de cinéastes font abstraction des définitions et des genres pour produire des films qui ignorent ces frontières. Jacques Prévert disait, à propos d'Arletty dans « Les Enfants du paradis » : « Tout film est un documentaire. Des fois c'est la mer, des fois c'est n'importe quoi d'autre, des fois c'est les êtres humains, comme on les appelle ».<br /><br />À travers son expérience de réalisation et d'accompagnement de films, Marine Ottogalli propose aux participant·e·s de questionner leurs propres envies de films et de les confronter aux étapes principales de la réalisation documentaire. Réalisatrice de documentaires (Ayi, 2019, Sveinn-à-Mulà, l'islandais qui n'avait plus d'essence), et directrice de la photo (Human, Yann-Arthus Bertrand, Les Reines du palace, Karine Morales, L'École est Finie, Julie Chauvin) Marine Ottogalli travaille depuis plus de dix ans dans l'industrie cinématographique. <br /><br />Cet atelier se déroulera dans Founders' Room de la Bibliothèque de référence.<br /><br />L'inscription à cet atelier commence le 28 novembre.<br /><br />Si vous avez des questions, contactez-nous à programmesenfrancais@tpl.ca<br /><br />****<br /><br />La Bibliothèque publique de Toronto s'est engagée à assurer l'accessibilité.

Tess and Emily are reeling after their ugly separation and fighting over ownership of the embryos that were supposed to grow their family together. And thousands of miles away, the unknown man who served as anonymous donor to them all is being held in captivity in Somalia. While his life remains in precarious balance, his genetic material is a source of both creation and conflict. What does it mean to be a family in our rapidly shifting world? What are our responsibilities to each other with increasing options for how to create a family? As these characters grapple with life-altering changes, they will find themselves interconnected in ways they cannot have imagined, and forced to redefine what family means to them.""<br /><br /><br />Future selections:<br />November 29: The Relatives by Camilla Gibb<br />December 27: The Refugees by Viet Thanh Nguyen<br /><br />This is a drop-in program.<br />For more information, please visit the branch or call 416-393-7663.<br /><br />Accessibility  <br /><br />Toronto Public Library is committed to accessibility.

Il soutint régulièrement la présence des artistes femmes dans les expositions de groupe. Mais le don qu'il fit de sa collection en 1894, une des plus importantes de son temps (Manet, Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, etc.), fut refusée par l'État français,  puis acceptée  mais seulement, hélas, en partie.
